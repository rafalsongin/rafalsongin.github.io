                How will football change in the decades ahead?

            <p>
                While many of the innovative technologies discussed in this article are either already available or being developed, we&#39;d also like to peek a little further into the future of football. Expectations are that towards 2050 and beyond, technological advances will have completely transformed this highly popular sport far beyond goal&#45;line sensors and virtual reality. Football training will undoubtedly also become increasingly advanced, with special balls that can tell you how to improve your control, aim, and power on the ball.

                Smart clothing items &#45; like gloves, shorts, shirts, pants, and bras &#45; are typically made from advanced textiles with interwoven circuitry, sensors, and additional hardware. Smart clothes connect to smartphone apps or laptops via Bluetooth or Wi&#45;Fi. Depending on the item and its purpose, smart clothes can gather all kinds of data, such as running speed, muscle activity, breathing rate, heart rate, temperature, step counting, calories consumed, altitude, distance tracking, fitness and stress levels, and many other metrics. Smart clothes and wearable devices provide unique opportunities to study athletes during competition and training, which leads to improved safety protocols and optimised performance.

                Augmented reality sports jersey
            </h2>
            <p>
                The official jersey for English Premier League team Southampton FC has received a high&#45;tech upgrade. Fans who scan the AR-enhanced sports jersey with their smartphones will see, for example, midfielder James Ward-Prowse appear in their homes in 3D. The jersey was created for the upcoming 2021/22 season, celebrating the team&#39;s 20th anniversary since moving to its current stadium, St Mary&#39;s. In the future, Southampton could upgrade their AR capabilities to project goal replays and other match highlights.

                Remote cheering

            <p>
                For football players it&#39;s no fun to play in an empty stadium either. In an attempt to recreate the atmosphere of a normal match, the instrument maker developed the &#39;Remote Cheerer powered by SoundUD&#39; app, which is connected to 58 speakers around the stadium. The system was initially developed for people unable to attend football matches in stadiums, such as hospitalised children, disabled and other supporters. During a trial match between Japanese football teams, spectators situated in various remote locations were able to use their smartphones to send cheers and applause into the stadium.

                VAR has left fans disappointed on various occasions, due to football players being caught offside by &#45; for instance &#45; their armpit, even though the rest of their body was well onside. To solve these challenges, FIFA is considering a new approach: the use of robots. And this is not a joke, as the sports organisation is planning to implement the technology in time for the 2022 World Cup. One of the systems being considered is the Tracab programme developed by Sweden&#39;s Chyron&#45;Hego. The technology makes use of AI&#45;driven ball tracking, in combination with limb tracking and skeletal modelling.

                How technology improves the game
            </h2>
            <p>
                Technology has completely disrupted the way football is played and experienced. Nearly everything that happens on the field, as multiple HD cameras enable us to see every move from all angles. Game information is transformed into statistics, which significantly enhance the game. We can see in which part of the field a player spends the most time, how many passes he made, where he made them, and to whom. New technologies on the field ensure that games are more enjoyable, especially when it leads to the correct decisions being made, which in turn leads to fewer game interruption, etc.
